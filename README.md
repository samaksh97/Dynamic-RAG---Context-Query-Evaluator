# Dynamic-RAG---Context-Query-Evaluator
This repository contains a framework for a dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system leveraging LangChain, PostgreSQL (PGVector), and an LLM to answer queries dynamically. It includes modules for initializing a vector store, handling retrieval chains, evaluating context quality, and fact-checking results.
